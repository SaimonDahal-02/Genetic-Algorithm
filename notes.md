## 1. Self-replication
each creature:
location;
genome = genetic information. dna/rna = chemical storage medium
neuralnet brain;

## 2. Blueprint

everycreature must be constructed using some blueprint.


## 3. Inherit
when creating a new child, we use some genome from one parent and some from another

## 4. Mutation
has to go occasional mutation.

## 5. Selection
who gets to reproduce and who doesn't




Genome length: 4 genes

4 genes make 4 neural connections.

differnt creature has differnt genomes with differnt brain and differnt in how they behave

4 neurons:
LPf = sensory input, population forward, senses the population density in their forwared direction of movement
MvE = ouput, move east
Mrn = output, move random
N0 = internal neuron
